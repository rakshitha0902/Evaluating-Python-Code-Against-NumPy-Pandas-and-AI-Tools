📊 Python Data Analysis Assignment
This repository contains a Python-based data analysis project focused on calculating summary statistics, evaluating performance, and testing code reusability across different datasets. The project is structured around three tasks using both raw Python and the Pandas library.

📁 Project Structure
File Name	Description
Code.ipynb	Jupyter Notebook containing all code for Task 1 (Pure Python), Task 2 (Pandas Efficiency), and Task 3 (Reusability).
NSE_BANKING_SECTOR.xls	Original dataset used in Task 1 and Task 2 for statistical analysis.
NSE_BANKING_SECTOR_duplicated.xls	Enlarged version of the original dataset used in Task 2 to test performance at scale.
ecommerce_sales_data.xls	Secondary dataset used in Task 3 to test the reusability of Task 1 code.
Python_Assignment_Report.docx	Final written report summarizing the project, findings, learnings, and reflections.

🔍 Tasks Overview
✅ Task 1: Summary Statistics using Pure Python
Used built-in modules like csv, loops, and lists.

Calculated mean, standard deviation, percentiles, mode, and frequency counts.

⚡ Task 2: Efficiency Comparison with Pandas
Replicated Task 1 using Pandas’ .describe() and .value_counts() for speed.

Measured runtime using the time module before and after increasing dataset size.

🔄 Task 3: Reusability Test on a New Dataset
Reapplied Task 1 logic to ecommerce_sales_data.xls.

Demonstrated minimal changes required to adapt code for a new dataset.

📚 Key Learnings
Understanding how to implement summary statistics manually in Python.

Exploring Pandas for faster, cleaner, and scalable data processing.

Learning to write modular and reusable code.

Measuring performance impact using runtime metrics.

🛠 Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

Excel (.xls format for datasets)
